    <h1>From changes in the Earth Orbit to African climate variability</h1>
    <p>There is intensive debate whether and how both long- and short-term
         climate changes have affected the evolution, dispersal and technological/cultural 
         innovation of our species Homo sapiens. To answer this question the analysis of sedimentary
          archives from Africa that captured the climate variability that hominins encountered are 
          necessary. Here, we present a ~620,000 year climate record from the Chew Bahir Basin (CHB) 
          situated in the southern Ethiopian rift. This paleoclimate record was collected ~90 km from 
          the famous Omo Kibish fossil locality, which represents the first documented appearance of 
          H. sapiens in eastern Africa. To decipher past climate variability in eastern Africa, we 
          utilized micro X-ray fluorescence data from the Chew Bahir sediment core and applied 
          a principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the factors controlling sediment composition, 
          representing wet and dry climate states. In a second step we calculated the wavelet power spectrum 
          from the first principal component (PC) to map temporal variations of orbitally-controlled cyclic 
          variations in the sediment composition. Our results show that the long-term wet-dry changes of 
          the eastern African climate recorded in the sediments of the CHB were mainly influenced by changes 
          in orbital eccentricity, with drier and more variable climate occurring at times of minima in the 400 kyr 
          band of the eccentricity cycle. In contrast, increased precipitation truncated with intermediate distinct 
          drying phases paced by orbital precession occurred mainly during eccentricity maxima. The orbital-scale 
          insolation forced humidity changes would have had an impact on the habitat of H. sapiens in the region. 
          As an example, the transition from Acheulean to Middle Stone Age (MSA) documented in the Olorgesailie Basin 
          coincides with a pronounced eccentricity minimum, accompanied with reduced moisture availability and repeated abrupt 
          climate transitions. In contrast, during the first documented appearance of H. sapiens in eastern Africa climate was humid and less variable.

    <p> Results of the time-series analysis of the CHB composite core. (A) PC1 (33% of variance explained); positive values indicate increased aridity whilst negative values indicate humid climate conditions. The grey boxes represent the archaeological epochs Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Acheulean after Deino et al., 2018, and a transition between the epochs. (B) The windowed variability analysis using
        a window size of 40 kyrs; the yellow colour indicate variability values above the median distance between the first quartile and the median of the distribution, while orange colours indicate variability values below the median. (C) Wavelet power spectrum of the PC1 scores. The frequencies of orbital precession (~20 kyrs period), eccentricity (~100 kyrs period), obliquity (~40 kyrs period) and
        half precession (~10 kyrs) are marked by white dashed lines. The black line marks the cone of influence (COI) of the wavelet power spectrum. Results outside the COI are influenced by edge effects and should therefore be excluded from the interpretation.</p>
