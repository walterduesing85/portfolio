    <h1>Factors controlling
        millenial-scale erosion in the
        NW Argentine Andes:
        Toro Basin, Eastern Cordillera</h1>
    <p>To understand the feedback mechanism on climate, tectonics and erosion, the
        Eastern Cordillera of the NW Argentine Andes provides an excellent laboratory. It has a
        strong climatic gradient, resulting in a humid subtropical eastern flank of the mountain
        range and an arid interior. Eight new cosmogenic derived erosion rates and eleven additional erosion rates
        from Bookhagen and Strecker (2012) have shown that erosion in the Toro Basin responds
        to two different climate regimes. In the orogen interior moisture is blocked by topography
        resulting in low precipitation, sparse vegetation and slow erosion rates (< 0.2 mm / year).
        The humid regime shows strong seasonable precipitation, landslide activity, fast erosion
        rates (0.2 – 1.3 mm / year), steeper hillslopes and a denser vegetation. Topographic metrics
        and stream power laws explain erosion rates < 0.2 mm / year in the Toro Basin. Landscape
        denudation processes beyond this threshold are controlled by frequency of landslide occurrence.
    Three tools are used to analyze the interdependent feedback cycles believed
        to control denudation processes in the Toro Basin:  a satellite derived
        vegetation index named the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) with a resolution of 250 m;
        a 90 m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM); and
        a satellite derived calibrated precipitation measuring tool, the Tropical Rainforest Measurement
        Mission (TRMM). Further the study shows, that catchment-wide erosion rates
        peak at structurally stressed zones in the transition between the arid and humid regime.
